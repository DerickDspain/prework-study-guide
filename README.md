## Description

Much more will be added to the notes in the future, as this may be the "final" layout of this project more material will be added in the future as I progress through my courses!

My motivation for this project came from the desire to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git, so that in hopes one day I may use these skills in a real world setting.
I built this project for the purpose of aiding myself, and my peers as a reference and guide in the weeks to come.
I myself believe this project solves one of the many problems a student has while attending any courses whether it be in grade school, college or even in a professional setting which is the ability and capability of having a place to store notes and be able to refer to them when needed.
In doing this I learned the beginnings of the basic foundations of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I also realized that I have much more to soak in to be able to understand how everything works and when to apply it.
